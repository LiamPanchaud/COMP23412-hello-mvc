# Eclipse launchers for mvc-dev

## Synopsis

These launch files are set up to run various configurations of `mvc-dev` from within Eclipse.

* `mvc-dev package.launch` runs all tests and then creates a runnable `jar` file, with all required dependencies, so that `mvc-dev` can be run from the command-line.
* `mvc-dev run.launch` runs `mvc-dev` within Eclipse.
* `mvc-dev test.launch` runs all the tests included for `mvc-dev`.

## Usage

1. Right-click on a `.launch` file and select `Run As -> <launch name>` to use it.
1. The launch configuration should now also be available from the `Run` menu and tool-bar button.
